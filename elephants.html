                   <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth. Known for their huge size, long trunks, and large ears, they belong to the family Elephantidae. They are intelligent and social animals, often living in tight-knit herds. Elephants are well-known for their ability to communicate through low-frequency sounds that humans can’t hear.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Elephants are herbivores and spend a large portion of their day eating. They consume grasses, fruits, tree bark, and leaves. Their trunks are incredibly versatile, allowing them to reach up to high branches or grab food from the ground. A single elephant can eat up to 300 pounds of food in one day, making them true giants of the animal kingdom.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Elephants are found in both grasslands and forests across Africa and Asia. In the wild, they roam vast distances in search of food and water. At the zoo, elephants are often provided with a spacious, natural-like environment, featuring large areas for them to roam, mud wallows for bathing, and shade from trees to keep cool.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Did you know that elephants are the only animals that can't jump? While they may not be able to leap, they are incredibly strong and can use their trunks to lift objects that weigh as much as 600 pounds! Their trunks are not only for grabbing food, but they also help them drink water, bathe, and even greet other elephants with a gentle touch. Elephants have a remarkable memory too — they can remember the faces of other elephants and humans for many years, helping them stay connected with their families and recognize those they've met before.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>If you're looking to see our majestic elephants, head over to the African Safari area near the back of the zoo. As you walk along the main pathway, you'll come across a large, open space with a few trees and a sandy area — that's where our elephants love to spend their time. The herd can often be seen resting under the shade of the trees or splashing around in a large mud pit. Keep your eyes peeled, and you might even catch one of the younger elephants playfully chasing after a butterfly or waving its trunk in the air. It's the perfect spot to observe these gentle giants up close!</p>
