                   <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Giraffes are the tallest land mammals on Earth, known for their long necks and legs. These gentle giants belong to the family Giraffidae and are instantly recognizable by their unique coat patterns, which can vary between individuals, ranging from light brown to dark reddish-brown patches separated by white or cream-colored lines. Giraffes are herbivores and spend most of their time browsing on trees, particularly acacias, using their long necks to reach high branches that other animals canâ€™t access.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruits from trees. Their long necks and prehensile tongues, which can extend up to 18 inches, help them grab leaves from tall trees like acacias, which make up a large part of their diet. They also enjoy browsing on shrubs and can consume up to 75 pounds of food each day! Due to their height, giraffes have access to food that other herbivores cannot reach, giving them a distinct advantage in their environment. Despite eating large quantities of food, they only need to drink water every few days, as they get moisture from the plants they eat.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Giraffes are native to the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of Africa. They can be found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. These animals are well-suited for living in areas with sparse trees and open plains, as their tall stature helps them spot predators from a distance. At the zoo, giraffes are typically housed in expansive, grassy enclosures with a variety of tall trees for them to browse from. These enclosures are designed to replicate their natural habitat, providing them with the space they need to roam freely and interact with each other.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Did you know that giraffes only need to sleep for about 10 minutes to 2 hours a day? They often take short naps while standing up, but they may also lie down for deeper rest. Interestingly, giraffes communicate with each other using low-frequency sounds that are inaudible to humans. These sounds help them stay in touch with others in the herd. Giraffes also have a remarkable ability to run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour, even with their long legs!</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>You can find our majestic giraffes in the African Safari area of the zoo. As you walk through this section, you'll notice a large, open space filled with tall trees and plenty of room for them to roam. The giraffes can often be seen browsing on the tree branches or casually walking across the enclosure, showing off their unique, towering necks. It's the perfect spot to catch a glimpse of these beautiful animals as they interact with one another and enjoy their natural behaviors in a spacious environment.</p>
