                   <h3>LION</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Lions are large, powerful carnivores and are often called the "King of the Jungle." They belong to the big cat family, Felidae, and are the only species of big cats that live in groups called prides. These magnificent creatures are known for their muscular bodies, golden-brown coats, and majestic manes (in males). Lions are social animals, unlike other big cats, and live in family groups that hunt, raise their young, and defend their territory together. Lions have an impressive roar that can be heard up to 5 miles away, which they use to communicate with pride members and to ward off other animals.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Lions are carnivores and are skilled hunters. They typically hunt in groups, with females doing most of the hunting while males protect the pride. Their diet consists mainly of large herbivores such as zebras, antelope, and buffalo. Lions are opportunistic hunters and will scavenge when needed. Once they have successfully captured their prey, the whole pride shares the meal, with the males eating first. Lions have strong jaws and sharp teeth designed for taking down and consuming large animals. They can eat up to 15 pounds of meat in a single meal.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Lions are found in the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. A small population of Asiatic lions can be found in the Gir Forest of India. In the wild, lions live in large territories that they defend from other predators. At the zoo, lions are housed in spacious enclosures that mimic their natural habitat, with wide open areas for roaming, shade for resting, and places to hide or take cover when they want privacy. These enclosures are designed to give them plenty of room to display their natural behaviors, such as lounging in the sun or playing with each other.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Did you know that a lion’s roar can be heard up to 5 miles away? Their roars are not only a way to communicate with other lions in their pride, but they also serve to establish their presence and warn intruders to stay away. Lions also sleep a lot, up to 20 hours a day! This is because hunting requires a lot of energy, so they rest during the day to be ready for nighttime hunting. Male lions, with their large, impressive manes, are often seen as symbols of strength and power, while females do most of the hunting and nurturing of the young.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>If you want to see our mighty lions, head to the African Savanna area of the zoo. The lion enclosure is located near the large grasslands, where you can watch the pride lounging in the sun or engaging in playful activities. Lions are typically most active in the early morning or late afternoon, so make sure to visit during these times for the best chance of seeing them up close. You may also catch a glimpse of the lion's roar, which echoes through the zoo — a true reminder of their power and majesty.</p>
