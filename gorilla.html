                   <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Gorillas are the largest species of primates and are known for their impressive strength and social behavior. They belong to the family Hominidae, which includes humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans. Gorillas have large, muscular bodies, broad chests, and thick fur that is typically black or dark brown. They live in groups called troops, usually led by a dominant silverback male. Gorillas are gentle and intelligent animals, with complex communication systems involving vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Gorillas are herbivores, primarily eating leaves, fruits, stems, and bamboo. They have strong jaws and teeth that allow them to crush and chew tough plant matter. A gorilla's diet can vary depending on the availability of food, but they tend to favor leaves and fruits from trees and plants in their natural habitat. They consume up to 40 pounds of vegetation per day! Although they are not carnivores, gorillas have been known to occasionally eat ants or termites, but these make up a very small portion of their diet.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Gorillas are native to the dense forests of central Africa, where they live in mountainous and lowland rainforests. They thrive in areas with abundant vegetation and cover, which allows them to build nests for sleeping and forage for food. In the zoo, gorillas are housed in spacious enclosures that mimic their natural habitat. These enclosures feature a variety of climbing structures, ropes, and plenty of greenery, allowing the gorillas to move around and engage in natural behaviors like foraging and resting in their nests.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Did you know that gorillas are incredibly strong? A gorilla is estimated to be about 4 to 9 times stronger than a human, especially in their upper body. Despite their immense strength, gorillas are usually calm and peaceful, preferring to avoid conflict. Their intelligence is remarkable, too – gorillas can use tools, recognize themselves in mirrors, and even learn sign language to communicate with humans. They are also excellent swimmers, although they rarely swim in the wild due to the dense forests they inhabit.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>To see our powerful and intelligent gorillas, head to the Rainforest Exhibit located near the center of the zoo. As you enter the area, you’ll find a lush, green environment filled with trees, vines, and climbing platforms, creating a natural space for the gorillas to explore. The gorillas can often be seen resting in the shade, playing with each other, or interacting with the enrichment items provided by zookeepers. Look for the silverback male, who often leads the group, and enjoy watching these magnificent creatures as they engage in their social activities.</p>
