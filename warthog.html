                   <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa, easily recognized by their distinctive tusks and tough, wrinkled skin. They are members of the pig family and are known for their sturdy build and unique facial features. Warthogs have large, curved tusks that protrude from both the upper and lower jaws. These tusks are used for defense and in fights with other warthogs. Despite their tough appearance, warthogs are generally peaceful animals and prefer to avoid confrontation. They are primarily ground dwellers and are often found in open savannas and woodlands.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Warthogs are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, roots, berries, and small invertebrates. They use their sharp tusks to dig up the ground in search of food, particularly roots and bulbs. Warthogs are also known to eat carrion (the flesh of dead animals) and will occasionally scavenge from other animals' kills. At the zoo, they are provided with a balanced diet that includes vegetables, fruits, and specially prepared food that replicates the variety of their natural diet.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Warthogs are found in the savannas, grasslands, and woodland areas of sub-Saharan Africa. They prefer open land with sparse vegetation, which allows them to see predators from a distance. In the wild, they are often seen near water sources, where they can cool off and wallow in the mud. At the zoo, warthogs are housed in enclosures designed to mimic their natural habitat. These areas have plenty of open spaces for running and digging, with mud wallows for the warthogs to enjoy, as well as shady areas where they can rest.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Warthogs are excellent runners! When they feel threatened, they can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour, which helps them escape predators. Despite their awkward appearance, warthogs are very agile. They also have an interesting way of getting around: instead of walking or running with their heads down like most pigs, warthogs often run with their heads held high, almost like they're looking for trouble. Their keen eyesight helps them spot danger from far away.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>To see our entertaining warthogs, head over to the African Savannah exhibit. Youâ€™ll find them in the open, grassy areas of the exhibit, where they enjoy digging and foraging. The warthogs are often seen lounging in the shade or resting in their mud wallows. If you're lucky, you might catch them running across the exhibit or playfully interacting with each other. This area is home to several other African species, so be sure to check out the surrounding animals while you're here!</p>
