                   <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Gemsboks are large, strong antelopes that belong to the family Bovidae. Known for their striking appearance, they have long, straight horns and a tan-colored body with distinct black markings on their faces, legs, and sides. These hardy animals are well-adapted to life in the harsh desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa. Gemsboks are known for their resilience and are capable of surviving without water for long periods, obtaining moisture from the plants they consume.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Gemsboks are herbivores and graze on a variety of plants, including grasses, leaves, and shrubs. They are particularly adept at surviving in arid environments where food is scarce, and they can go without drinking water for weeks by feeding on moisture-rich vegetation. Their diet mainly consists of dry, tough plants that most other animals can't eat, allowing them to thrive in the desert landscapes of southern Africa. Gemsboks are also known to occasionally browse on shrubs or small trees to supplement their diet.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Gemsboks are native to the arid regions of southern Africa, primarily found in deserts and dry grasslands. They prefer open plains, where they can roam freely and are able to find food and shelter. These animals are well-suited for harsh climates, with their hooves designed to handle the hot and rocky terrain. In the zoo, gemsoks are usually housed in spacious, dry, and open enclosures that mimic their natural habitat, featuring sandy ground and sparse vegetation. This helps them feel at home while allowing visitors to observe their graceful movements in a similar environment to their wild counterparts.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Did you know that the gemsbok’s horns are not just for defense? In the wild, they use their sharp, pointed horns to fight off predators and establish dominance within their herds. These impressive horns can reach lengths of up to 3 feet! Interestingly, a gemsbok’s horns are capable of withstanding high amounts of pressure without breaking, even during intense battles. Additionally, these animals can run incredibly fast—up to 40 miles per hour—making them one of the fastest animals in their range. Their speed and agility help them avoid predators in the wild.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>To see our beautiful gemsbok, head towards the African Savannah area of the zoo. You’ll find them in a spacious, sunlit exhibit designed to mimic their natural desert environment. They can often be seen grazing on the grasses or standing tall under the shade of a small tree. If you’re lucky, you might catch them in a playful interaction with each other, or perhaps witnessing one of their impressive high-speed sprints around their enclosure. It’s a great spot for visitors looking to see these incredible animals up close!</p>
