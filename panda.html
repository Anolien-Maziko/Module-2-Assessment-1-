                   <h3>PANDA</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Pandas are large, adorable bears that are native to China. Known for their distinctive black and white fur, they are one of the most beloved animals in the world. There are two species of panda: the giant panda and the red panda. The giant panda, which is the most famous, is known for its round face and gentle nature. Pandas are primarily solitary animals, with each adult panda maintaining its own territory. They are also excellent climbers and swimmers, although they spend most of their time on the ground in forests or bamboo forests.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Pandas are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of bamboo. In fact, bamboo makes up about 99% of their diet! They eat various parts of the bamboo plant, including the leaves, stems, and shoots. Although pandas have the digestive system of a carnivore, they have adapted to eating bamboo due to a special wrist bone that functions like a thumb, allowing them to grasp the bamboo. Despite this, they must eat large amounts of bamboo—up to 40 pounds a day—to meet their nutritional needs. At the zoo, pandas are fed fresh bamboo, and their diet may also include fruits, vegetables, and specially prepared nutrition biscuits to supplement their diet.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Pandas are native to the mountainous regions of central China, where bamboo forests provide both their food and shelter. They typically live in temperate forests at high altitudes, where the climate is cooler and the bamboo grows abundantly. In the zoo, pandas are housed in spacious, forest-like enclosures that mimic their natural environment. These enclosures feature bamboo groves, trees, and plenty of space for the pandas to move around and play. Pandas enjoy having secluded spaces for resting, as they often spend a lot of time alone, eating, and sleeping.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Pandas are excellent swimmers! Despite their bulky size, they are very skilled in the water and can swim across rivers and streams. Interestingly, pandas have a unique "thumb" – it's not actually a true thumb, but a modified wrist bone that helps them grip bamboo stalks. This helps them pick up food with great precision, almost like using human hands. Pandas also have a very low reproductive rate, which is why they are considered vulnerable. Female pandas are only fertile for a few days each year, and it can be very challenging for them to successfully raise cubs in the wild.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>You can find our lovable pandas in the Bamboo Forest section of the zoo. As you walk through the lush green area, you’ll notice their spacious enclosures filled with towering bamboo plants. The pandas love to munch on bamboo and often spend time lounging around, resting after a big meal. Look for the giant panda resting on a perch, or see if you can spot them gently climbing the trees. The pandas’ relaxed, slow movements make them a favorite among visitors. They are usually most active during feeding times, so be sure to visit during those hours for the best experience!</p>
