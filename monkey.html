                   <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Monkeys are playful, intelligent mammals that belong to the primate family. There are over 260 species of monkeys, and they can be found all over the world, from rainforests to savannas. Monkeys are known for their long tails, dexterous hands, and keen sense of curiosity. They are highly social animals, living in groups called troops, and they communicate with each other through sounds, facial expressions, and body language. Some monkeys are tree-dwellers, while others live on the ground. They are very agile and can often be seen swinging from tree to tree, using their tails and hands for balance.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Monkeys are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. Their diet typically consists of fruits, leaves, flowers, insects, and even small animals or birds in some cases. Some monkeys, like howler monkeys, are primarily herbivores, while others, like macaques, enjoy a more varied diet, including nuts, seeds, and even human food if they can get their hands on it. Their strong teeth and nimble fingers help them peel fruits, crack nuts, and even use tools to get their food. At the zoo, monkeys are fed a balanced diet that includes fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other foods to mimic their natural diet.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Monkeys are found in various habitats around the world, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and even mountain ranges. In the wild, monkeys spend a lot of time in the trees, where they can move safely from branch to branch, foraging for food and staying away from predators. At the zoo, monkeys are often housed in spacious enclosures designed to replicate their natural habitat. These enclosures usually have plenty of climbing structures, ropes, and trees to allow them to exhibit natural behaviors like swinging and playing. Zoos also provide monkeys with enrichment activities, such as toys and puzzles, to keep them mentally stimulated.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Did you know that some monkeys use tools? Capuchin monkeys, for example, are known to use sticks to crack open nuts and even stones to help them find insects hidden under tree bark. They are one of the few non-human animals to use tools in the wild! Monkeys are also highly social animals and spend a lot of time grooming each other to strengthen bonds within their troop. Additionally, some monkeys have very distinct vocalizations. For example, howler monkeys are famous for their loud, guttural calls that can be heard over long distances, which they use to communicate with other groups.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>To see our lively monkeys, head to the Primate Exhibit near the Rainforest section of the zoo. Here, you'll find various species of monkeys, from playful spider monkeys swinging through the trees to curious macaques hopping around their enclosure. The monkeys often interact with each other, climbing, playing, and foraging for food. Look up into the treetops, and you might catch a glimpse of a monkey hanging by its tail or leaping from one branch to another. Be sure to stop by during feeding time to watch them enjoy their treats!</p>
