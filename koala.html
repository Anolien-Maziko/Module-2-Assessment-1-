                   <h3>KOALA</h3>
                   <strong> What they are:</strong>
                   <p>Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia. Known for their round faces, fluffy ears, and large, black noses, koalas are often mistaken for bears due to their appearance, but they are actually marsupials, like kangaroos and wombats. These adorable animals are typically solitary and spend most of their time sleeping or resting in eucalyptus trees. Koalas have thick, soft fur that helps protect them from the harsh Australian sun and keeps them warm during cooler nights. They are primarily nocturnal and very slow-moving, spending their days lounging in the trees.</p>
                    <strong>Diet</strong>
                    <p>Koalas are herbivores that mainly eat eucalyptus leaves, which make up almost their entire diet. Eucalyptus leaves are tough and fibrous, and they don’t provide a lot of energy, so koalas must eat a large amount to survive—up to 2.5 pounds of leaves each day! The leaves are low in nutrients, so koalas conserve energy by resting up to 20 hours a day. They are very selective about the types of eucalyptus trees they feed on, favoring certain species over others. Koalas have a special digestive system that allows them to break down the toxins in the leaves.</p>
                    <strong>Habitat</strong>
                    <p>Koalas are found in the wild in the coastal areas and forests of eastern and southeastern Australia. They prefer eucalyptus forests, as these trees provide both food and shelter. In the zoo, koalas are kept in enclosures designed to simulate their natural habitat, with plenty of eucalyptus trees for them to climb and rest in. Koalas are not territorial but are known to have home ranges, which they use to navigate between the best feeding areas. These enclosures are often filled with branches and greenery to give koalas a familiar, comfortable environment where they can rest and eat.</p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong>
                    <p>Koalas are one of the sleepiest animals in the world! They can sleep for up to 18–22 hours a day. Their sleepiness is due to their low-energy diet of eucalyptus leaves, which take a long time to digest. Koalas have a very good sense of smell, which helps them pick the best eucalyptus leaves. Despite their cute, calm demeanor, koalas can make loud, bellowing calls, which can be heard from a distance. These calls are mostly heard during mating season and are used by males to attract females or warn other males to stay away from their territory.</p>
                    <strong>Where You Can Find Them at the Zoo</strong>
                    <p>If you’d like to see our adorable koalas, head over to the Australian Outback section of the zoo. This area has a peaceful, tree-filled enclosure designed to look like their natural habitat. You can often spot the koalas high up in the eucalyptus trees, peacefully napping or slowly munching on leaves. They love to sleep in the branches, so be sure to look up! The koalas are typically most active in the early morning or late afternoon, so plan your visit accordingly to get the best view of these sleepy, charming animals.</p>
